          Hey there! I'm Ayush, a full-stack developer with a deep passion for
          building modern web applications. Over the past few years, Iâ€™ve honed
          my skills in **React**, **Node.js**, and **TypeScript**, developing
          both frontend and backend systems. Currently, Iâ€™m diving into the
          exciting world of **Blockchain development**, working with
          **Solidity** and exploring **decentralized applications (dApps)**.
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
          contributing to open-source projects, or reading about the future of
          **Web3**. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn, grow, and
          create impactful solutions in the ever-evolving tech world. Feel free
          to check out my projects or connect with me!ðŸ’ª
